This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This server was created as the backend to fitness-client. 
To run this server, clone this repo. 
After cloning, run npm install to ensure you have all the correct packages. 
Lastly, run the command npm run dev_windows 
This will create the server connection and now you can move onto the other repo, fitness-client.
